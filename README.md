# No People, Flowers or Bikes 

Fork of [Distrotube's](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) wallpaper collection with many of the people, flowers and bikes removed and replaced.

This repo is mostly for sharing across my own personal devices.

## Where Did I Get These?

[DT](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) mostly sourced them from [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg) and some default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions he has installed.

This repo is supplemented with additional images mostly from [Wallpaper Flare](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/) and [Wallpaper Safari](https://wallpapersafari.com/).  

## Style of Wallpapers

The original collection was mostly landscapes. For some reason images of people and --- occasionally flowers and bicycles --- bothers me, so I replaced them with urban scenes, art deco facades, vector art and vaporwave.

## Ownership

If you find an image hosted on this repository that is yours please contact me if you want me to include a credit or rmove the image completely.
